    					<li><strong>2.50</strong> <span>Suppliers may not require Buyers to leave specific feedback. Suppliers may not demand that Buyers withdraw existing feedback. These prohibitions apply to all feedback activity, whether prior to, during, or after delivery of services described in the original Buyer Listing.</span></li>
    					<li><strong>2.51</strong> <span>Feedback comments must comply with rules on feedback listed on the site. AnyVan reserve the right to remove or modify feedback left by either the buyer or supplier without prior consent of either parties.</span></li>
    					<li><strong>2.52</strong> <span>Reputation score is a score based on Buyer feedback from previous jobs, representing the trustworthiness of a Supplier on a scale of 0 to 100.</span></li>
    					<li><strong>2.52.1</strong> <span>The reputation score of Suppliers is calculated via a formula rounded to the closest integer. This formula to round means 100 multiplied by a fraction, where the numerator is the total number of positive feedbacks since launch, and the denominator is the total number of negative feedbacks added to the total number of positive feedbacks since launch, as per the last updated score. This rule applies if a provider has less than 20 pieces of feedback.</span></li>
    					<li><strong>2.52.2</strong> <span>If at last reputation score update time the total number of positive and negative feedbacks left on the specific Supplier between last reputation score update time and 12 months before last reputation score update time were not less than 20, we calculate a more up-to-date reputation score until the next update. We calculate Reputation Score from a rounded formula. This formula to round means 100 multiplied by a fraction, where the numerator is the total number of positive feedbacks between last reputation score update time and 12 months before last reputation score update time. The denominator is the total number of negative feedbacks added to the total number of positive feedbacks both between last reputation score update time and 12 months before last reputation score update time.</span></li>
    					<li><strong>2.52.3</strong> <span>A reputation score cannot exceed 100 of which if the figure is calculated as a decimal it will be rounded down to 99 if any Buyer left a negative feedback on that particular Supplier between last reputation score update time and 12 months before last reputation score update time. If a supplier has completed more than 20 jobs over a period of 12 months negative feedback will be reflected within the percentage as per the last feedback update.</span></li>

No request should be made within 7 days of the date of acceptance of the Bid or until reasonable attempts have been made to agree the terms of cancellation directly.</span></li>
    					<li><strong>2.60</strong> <span>We will review all cancellation requests. If appropriate the cancelled transport requirement will be relisted on the Site or deleted from it.

Anyvan cannot be liable for requests outside this timeframe. No cash refund will be provided once the buyer has received the contact details of the Supplier via AnyVan.
